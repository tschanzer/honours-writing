\section{Problem statement}
\rb{} convection is the motion of a fluid confined between two horizontal
isothermal plates, the temperature of the bottom plate being higher than that
of the top plate. The governing equations for the flow follow from the
Navier-Stokes equations of mass, energy and momentum conservation. The reader
is referred to \textcite{chandrasekhar1961} for a detailed derivation; I
summarise the assumptions and approximations involved below.

The density, $\rho$, of the fluid is related to its temperature $T$ by the
linear equation of state
\[
    \rho = \rho_0 [1 - \alpha(T - T_0)],
\]
where $\alpha$ is the (constant) volume coefficient of thermal expansion and
$\rho_0$ and $T_0$ are the base-state density and temperature such that $\rho =
\rho_0$ when $T = T_0$. The key assumption is that density variations are small
($\alpha (T - T_0) \ll 1$), which allows the governing equations to be
simplified under the \emph{Boussinesq approximation}. The Boussinesq
approximation involves first writing the pressure, $p$, of the fluid as
\[
    p = p_0 - \rho_0 gz + p',
\]
where $p_0$ is an arbitrary constant, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity
and $z$ is the vertical coordinate. $p'$ is the (time-varying) deviation from a
hydrostatically balanced background profile $p_0 - \rho_0 gz$ in which the
upward pressure gradient force per unit volume $\rho_0 g$ cancels the downward
weight force per unit volume $-\rho_0 g$. Since $\alpha (T - T_0) \ll 1$,
density variations are neglected everywhere except in their contribution to the
weight force, leading to a net buoyant (background pressure gradient plus
weight) force per unit mass
\[
    \frac{\rho_0 - \rho}{\rho_0} g = \alpha (T - T_0) g.
\]

With these assumptions in mind, I adopt the governing equations as they are
derived by \textcite{chandrasekhar1961}:
\begin{alignat}{2}
    \label{eqn:dim_momentum}
    \pdiff{\vec{u}}{t} + \vec{u} \cdot \grad \vec{u} &= -\frac{1}{\rho_0} \grad
        p' + \alpha (T - T_0) g \uvec{z} + \nu \nabla^2 \vec{u} &\quad&
        \text{(momentum conservation),} \\
    \label{eqn:dim_energy}
    \pdiff{T}{t} + \vec{u} \cdot \grad T &= \kappa \nabla^2 T && \text{(energy
        conservation), and} \\
    \label{eqn:dim_incompressible}
    \grad \cdot \vec{u} &= 0 && \text{(incompressibility).}
\end{alignat}
$\vec{u}$ is the fluid velocity, $t$ is time, $\uvec{z}$ is the upward unit
vector, $\nu$ is the (constant) kinematic viscosity and $\kappa$ is the thermal
diffusivity (also constant). Notice that the aforementioned buoyancy term
$\alpha (T - T_0) g$ appears on the right-hand side of \cref{eqn:dim_momentum}.

The parametrisation test-bed developed in this work solves the governing
equations in a two-dimensional domain $(x,z) \in [0, d] \times [0, L]$, subject
to no-slip, isothermal boundary conditions on the top and bottom plates,
\begin{alignat}{3}
    \label{eqn:dim_bc_bot}
    \vec{u} &= \vec{0}, &\quad T &= T_0 + \frac{\delta T}{2} &\qquad& \text{at
    } z = 0 \text{ and} \\
    \label{eqn:dim_bc_top}
    \vec{u} &= \vec{0}, &\quad T &= T_0 - \frac{\delta T}{2} &\qquad& \text{at
    } z = d,
\end{alignat}
and periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal,
\begin{alignat}{2}
    \label{eqn:dim_bc_sides}
    \vec{u}(x=0) &= \vec{u}(x=L) &\quad \text{and} \quad T(x=0) &= T(x=L).
\end{alignat}
$\delta T$ is the constant temperature difference between the plates.

\section{Nondimensionalisation and scale analysis}
It is helpful to nondimensionalise the governing equations
\crefrange{eqn:dim_momentum}{eqn:dim_bc_sides}; this is not only useful for
numerical work but also gives insight into the different flow regimes that are
possible. A range of nondimensionalisations are used in fluid dynamics
literature; I adopt a common one \parencite[see,
e.g.,][]{grotzbach1983,ouertatani2008,stevens2010} which is suitable for the
turbulent convective regime.

For low-viscosity, turbulent flow, a suitable time scale is the \emph{free-fall
time} $t_0$, which is the time for a fluid element with constant temperature $T
= T_0 - \delta T$ to fall from the top plate to the bottom plate under the
influence of buoyancy ($-g \alpha \delta T$) alone. It is simple to show that
\[
    t_0 \sim \left( \frac{d}{g \alpha \delta T} \right)^{1/2},
\]
ignoring a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. The obvious length and temperature scales are
the plate separation $d$ and temperature difference $\delta T$, respectively.

Making the substitutions $p'/\rho_0 \to \pi$ and $T - T_0 \to \theta$ in
\crefrange{eqn:dim_momentum}{eqn:dim_bc_sides} and expressing all variables in
units of $t_0$, $d$ and $\delta T$ leads to the dimensionless equations
\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:momentum}
    \pdiff{\vec{u}}{t} + \vec{u} \cdot \grad \vec{u}
        &= -\grad \pi + \left( \frac{\prandtl}{\rayleigh}\right)^{1/2}
        \nabla^2 \vec{u} + \theta \uvec{z}, \\
    \label{eqn:energy}
    \pdiff{\theta}{t} + \vec{u} \cdot \grad \theta
        &= (\rayleigh\,\prandtl)^{-1/2} \, \nabla^2 \theta, \quad \text{and} \\
    \label{eqn:incompressible}
    \grad \cdot \vec{u} &= 0,
\end{align}
with boundary conditions
\begin{gather}
\begin{alignat}{3}
    \label{eqn:bc_bot}
    \vec{u} &= \vec{0}, &\quad \theta &= +\frac{1}{2}
    &\qquad& \text{at } z = 0, \\
    \label{eqn:bc_top}
    \vec{u} &= \vec{0}, &\quad \theta &= -\frac{1}{2}
    &\qquad& \text{at } z = 1,
\end{alignat} \\
\begin{alignat}{2}
    \label{eqn:bc_sides}
    \vec{u}(x=0) &= \vec{u}(x=\Gamma)
    &\quad \text{and} \quad \theta(x=0) &= \theta(x=\Gamma).
\end{alignat}
\end{gather}
There are three dimensionless parameters: the aspect ratio of the domain
\[
    \Gamma \equiv \frac{L}{d},
\]
the \emph{Prandtl number}
\[
    \prandtl \equiv \frac{\nu}{\kappa}
\]
which measures the relative importance of viscosity (momentum diffusivity) and
thermal diffusivity, and the \emph{Rayleigh number}
\[
    \rayleigh \equiv \frac{g \alpha d^3 \delta T}{\kappa \nu}.
\]
The Rayleigh number can be interpreted as the ratio of the time scale for
thermal transport by conduction to the time scale for thermal transport by
convection. It determines the importance of diffusion for the evolution of
$\vec{u}$ and $\theta$; inspection of \cref{eqn:momentum,eqn:energy} indicates
that low $\rayleigh$ implies strong diffusion and high $\rayleigh$ weak
diffusion. Detailed theoretical analysis of the governing equations (see, e.g.,
\textcite{chandrasekhar1961} and the seminal work by \textcite{rayleigh1916})
reveals that there exists a critical Rayleigh number (dependent on boundary
conditions but of order $\SI{e3}{}$), below which the equations have a stable
equilibrium with the fluid at rest and a linear conductive temperature profile.
Above the critical value, the equilibrium is unstable and small perturbations
lead to the formation of a regular series of steady, rotating convection cells.
If the Rayleigh number is increased much further (\textcite{le_quere1991} cites
$\rayleigh \approx \SI{2e8}{}$), the solution becomes unsteady and increasingly
turbulent. This work is concerned with the turbulent regime, since Rayleigh
numbers for atmospheric deep moist convection can be as large as $\SI{e22}{}$
\parencite{chilla2012}.
